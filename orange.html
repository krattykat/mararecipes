    <h1>Preparation</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the chicken, cut the boneless chicken thighs or tenders into small pieces, about 1/2 inch long. 
            </li>
        <li>Toss the chicken pieces in a bowl and coat with the flour, corn starch, black pepper, onion powder, salt and ginger powder.</li>
        <li>In a deep fraying pan, fry the pieces of chicken leaving some space between them to avoid over crowding. They will only need to be fried for about 2-3 minutes at the most until golden brown, because the pieces are small. Over cooking the chicken makes them chewy so be careful there.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is done cooking, drain well using a spider strainer spoon and transfer over to the cooked sauce. Toss well with the sauce and allow the chicken and the sauce to cook together for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve this simple Orange Chicken Recipe with some homemade Lo Mein Noodles or over white rice. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions to add color (optional).</li>
    </ol>
