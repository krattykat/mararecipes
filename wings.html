  <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <li>Chicken wings</li>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>

  <h1>Preparation</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Add ginger and garlic into a pot and then place the wings in it.</li>
    <li>Pour the sugar, soy sauce, and sake onto the chicken, and then put the pot over high heat to bring the liquid to a boil.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot with a lid and turn down the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Let this braise for 15 minutes for the sauce to soak into the chicken and for the fat in the chicken to render out. </li>
    <li>While the chicken is braising, preheat the oven to 430 degrees F (220 C) and prepare a sheet pan by placing a metal cooling rack on top.</li>
    <li>When the timer is up, transfer the wings to the rack and let the surface of the chicken dry out for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Put the pan in the oven and bake them until the skin is a rich brown color.</li>
    <li>To finish the teriyaki glaze, strain the braising liquid into another pot and skim off the excess fat using a spoon. Boil the braising liquid to reduce it until the bubbles are big and shiny and itâ€™s relatively thick.</li>
    <li>Once your chicken teriyaki wings are down browning, remove them from the oven and brush or spoon on the teriyaki sauce. </li>
    <li>You're done, now eat! :)</li>
  </ol>
